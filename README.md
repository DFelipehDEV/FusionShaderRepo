# FusionShaderList
Here's a collection of Clickteam Fusion shaders, at least half of it was either ported, improved, edited or made by me.
I'm listing and collecting all existing Fusion shaders. This obviously won't include private, paid, broken or WIP.

If you want to support my work:

As a goal, I'll be porting and creating more shaders, making examples of usage (and perhaps a gif preview), and in the future a software to download, search and manage the shaders.
